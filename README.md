# Star-Rain-Game

Star Rain is a 2D arcade-style game written in Python using the pygame library. The player is a purple rectangle who has to dodge falling yellow stars from the sky. The frequency of the stars increases gradually, and any collision of the player with a star brings the game to an end.

Instructions for Running the Game:

Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system. Download the game code and the background image ("pic1.jpg"). Run the game by executing the code in a Python environment. Use the left and right arrow keys to control the character and try to avoid the falling stars. Enjoyy!!
